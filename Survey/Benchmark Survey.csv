The reason is that for a more comprehensive information about an issue, we might have to go over the description (text, logs etc.) as well as the actual change(s) made in the source code. The former would be available on Jira, while latter is on Bitbucket.

- Currently, Jira can read some information from Bitbucket since both are provided by the same company, Atlassian. However, in general, given Jira (or, similar ticket management software) and GitHub (or, similar source management software), linking a ticket in Jira to a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub is an extremely useful feature to track what happened in the past for a particular issue.

- Searching for issues based on keywords is another extremely important feature. Jira does this to some extent. However, I believe there is a lot of improvement we can bring in using AI. For example, if one searches using  keywords in Jira, many irrelevant tickets get listed at the beginning. The person has to go over the listed tickets to find the right one. Not super convenient.

- You may also want to consider linking a third type of software that a customer support team would use. For example, Zoho Desk is used by the Tektelic customer support team. If the AI chatbot can identify any link of a  newly reported customer issue with the past Jira tickets and/or Bitbucket PR, then it might help to resolve the issue faster. Note that not all Jira tickets are created based on customer reported issues. Many are internal tickets, and hence a customer support member may not have visibility to the past design/development work around a particular customer issue.
